Supposition:
The League of Legends Ranked Match Makeing Algorithm results in a frequency of win and loss streaks across all accounts 
that would be statistically improbable in a true 50:50 matchmaking system.
When all acounts are on a streak 50% of the time winners and losers must be getting matched up against eachother.
This would mean that 50% of the people in a lobby are on a win or loss streak
If one account is win streaking then anther acount must be lose streaking

Hypothesis:
The Frequency of win and loss streaks (a streak being 3+ wins or losses in a row) across all accounts is aproximately 50% of the time.
Meaning that if you randomly pick any game an account has played this season there is 50% chance it is a part of a  streak. 
I suspect that this is a statistically improbable ratio of streaks for a 50:50 match making algorithm. 
Where the probability of winning 3 games in a row would be .5*.5*.5=12.5% chance aka there is a 12.5% chance  that a random game chosen is in 3 game streak (up to 25 because win and loss? I dont think so)

.5 % chance of one win .25% chance of two wins .5+.25= 75% chance a game is not a part of a 3+ win streak? 

Yeah im pretty sure you should only be win streaking 25% of the time. because half the time you should go 1 win 1 loss and the other 25% 2 wins 2 losses.

Actually maybe 50% of games should be 3+ streaks



Part 1:
Do the manual analysis and write up of my own account Saflurion or all 3

Copy wins and losses, equate groupings with probabilities
Calculate probability of all grouping occuring by averaging should give probability of that many winstreaks.

avg: 33.5625
so there is a 33.56 percent chance of having as many streaks as this account has.

43/65 = 66% of the games are a part of a 3+ game streak

Stat Question: if there is a 25% chance to win 2 games in a row w


these numbers suggest that the frequency of streaks don't actually exceed the projected probability

confused on how to distinguish between individual game probabilites vs streak probabilities

Part 2:
Use the api to auto analyse win streaks on all accounts

Part 3:
Calculate the percent of the time each streak is appears
